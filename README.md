# Incorporation of commonsense knowledge resources for Semantic Anomaly Detection in Process Mining

This is the code repository of the Master Thesis written by Guszt√°v Megyesi, submitted to the Data and Web Science Group of the University of Mannheim.

## Structure

The repository is split into two branches:

<b>main</b> This branch encompasses the code required to reproduce all results, except for tasks associated with Anomaly Classification

<b>semanticanomalydetection-anomalyclassification</b> This branch includes the code to reproduce the results for the Anomaly Classification tasks.

## Knowledge extraction

Extraction scripts and extracted knowledge records are stored in knowledgebase_population/additional_kb/

### ConceptNet

<b>kb_conceptnet.ser</b>: ConceptNet knowledge records extracted as dictionary

<b>conceptnet_crawler.py</b>: Crawler methods to retrieve JSON files from the ConceptNet API<br>
<b>conceptnet_extractor.py</b>: Retrieves and parses JSON files using the ConceptNet crawler, based on the activities in the synthetic BPMAI logs and their synonyms, stores output as text file<br>
<b>conceptnet_crawler.py</b>: Creates .ser file from the extracted ConceptNet content stored as text file<br>

### Atomic

<b>kb_atomic.ser</b>: Atomic knowledge records extracted as dictionary<br>
<b>atomic_extractor.py</b>: Parses Atomic flat files and outputs knowledge records as .ser file

### Knowledge base population

Knowledge base is populated using the corresponding method in the script knowledgebase_population/linguisticpopulator.py. This file replaces the original verboceanpopulator.py but preserves its structure.

## Reasoning engine improvements

This section provides a brief overview on the implementation of each improvement strategy, respectively. All of them, except Anomaly Classification, can be turned on using the respective flag when instantiating a respective Configuration object (c.f. anomalydetection/configuration.py).

### Business Object Matching

KnowledgeRecord object now contains an object to represent an associated business object. In the KnowledgeBase class, get_* functions have been added or modified to retrieve knowledge records belonging to certain object (c.f. 'obj' parameter). The anomaly checking functions (has_xxx_violation etc.) have been extended to consider whether an object parameter was supplied.

In the AnomalyDetector class, the function detect_anomalies_for_pair has been modified in a way that the object is extracted from the event label and supplied to the anomaly checking functions in the KnowledgeBase class.

<b>Main files affected:</b><br>
knowledgebase/knowledgerecord.py<br>
knowledgebase/knowledgebase.py<br>
anomalydetection/anomalydetector.py

### Knowledge Record Ranking

In the KnowledgeBase class, the anomaly checking functions (has_xxx_violation etc.) have been extended with an if-clause checking for the filter_heuristics_rank option. If it is active, then the ranks are collected for all knowledge records supporting and contradicting concerning a certain verb pair. The anomaly is only reported if the rank of supporting records is lower (=better) than the rank of contradicting records.

### Knowledge Record Confidence

### Anomaly Classification
