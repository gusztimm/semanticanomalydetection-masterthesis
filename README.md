# Incorporation of commonsense knowledge resources for Semantic Anomaly Detection in Process Mining

This is the code repository of the Master Thesis written by Guszt√°v Megyesi, submitted to the Data and Web Science Group of the University of Mannheim.

## Structure

The repository is split into two branches:

<b>main</b> This branch encompasses the code required to reproduce all results, except for tasks associated with Anomaly Classification

<b>semanticanomalydetection-anomalyclassification</b> This branch includes the code to reproduce the results for the Anomaly Classification tasks.

## Knowledge extraction

Extraction scripts and extracted knowledge records are stored in `knowledgebase_population/additional_kb/`

### ConceptNet

<b>`kb_conceptnet.ser`</b>: ConceptNet knowledge records extracted as dictionary
<b>`conceptnet_crawler.py`</b>: Crawler methods to retrieve JSON files from the ConceptNet API<br>
<b>`conceptnet_extractor.py`</b>: Retrieves and parses JSON files using the ConceptNet crawler, based on the activities in the synthetic BPMAI logs and their synonyms, stores output as text file<br>
<b>`conceptnet_crawler.py`</b>: Creates .ser file from the extracted ConceptNet content stored as text file<br>

### Atomic

<b>`kb_atomic.ser`</b>: Atomic knowledge records extracted as dictionary<br>
<b>`atomic_extractor.py`</b>: Parses Atomic flat files and outputs knowledge records as .ser file

### Knowledge base population

Knowledge base is populated using the corresponding method in the script `knowledgebase_population/linguisticpopulator.py`. This file replaces the original `verboceanpopulator.py` but preserves its structure.

## Reasoning engine improvements

This section provides a brief overview on the implementation of each improvement strategy, respectively. All of them, except Anomaly Classification, can be turned on using the respective flag when instantiating a respective Configuration object (c.f. `anomalydetection/configuration.py`).

### Business Object Matching

KnowledgeRecord object now contains an object to represent an associated business object. In the KnowledgeBase class, get_* functions have been added or modified to retrieve knowledge records belonging to certain object (c.f. 'obj' parameter). The anomaly checking functions (has_xxx_violation etc.) have been extended to consider whether an object parameter was supplied.

In the AnomalyDetector class, the function detect_anomalies_for_pair has been modified in a way that the object is extracted from the event label and supplied to the anomaly checking functions in the KnowledgeBase class.

<b>Main files affected:</b><br>
`knowledgebase/knowledgerecord.py`<br>
`knowledgebase/knowledgebase.py`<br>
`anomalydetection/anomalydetector.py`

### Knowledge Record Ranking

In the KnowledgeBase class, the anomaly checking functions (has_xxx_violation etc.) have been extended with an if-clause checking for the filter_heuristics_rank option. If it is active, then the ranks are collected for all knowledge records supporting and contradicting concerning a certain verb pair. The anomaly is only reported if the rank of supporting records is lower (=better) than the rank of contradicting records.

The ranks are stored in the KnowledgeBase class.

<b>Main files affected:</b><br>
`knowledgebase/knowledgebase.py`<br>

### Knowledge Record Confidence

In the KnowledgeBase class, the anomaly checking functions (has_xxx_violation etc.) have been extended with an if-clause checking for the filter_heuristics_cscore option. If it is active, then the confidence scores are collected for all knowledge records supporting and contradicting concerning a certain verb pair. The anomaly is only reported if the score of supporting records is higher than the rank of contradicting records.

<b>Main files affected:</b><br>
`knowledgebase/knowledgebase.py`<br>
`knowledgebase_population/linguisticpopulator.py` (for score calculation)<br>
`knowledgebase/similaritycomputer.py` (for calculating similarity-discounted scores)

### Anomaly Classification

The AnomalyDetector class has been modified in a way that the confidence scores triggering an anomaly are captured and supplied to the Anomaly object. The scores are initially reported using the anomaly checking functions (has_xxx_violation etc.).

The anomaly classification is executed by running anomalyclassifier.py in the root folder, which analyzes the scores contained in the Anomaly objects. To make all necessary calculations, a .ser file is required as input, which is produced by the synthetic evaluation as output.

<b>Main files affected:</b><br>
`anomalyclassifier.py`<br>
`anomalydetection/anomaly.py`<br>
`anomalydetection/anomalydetector.py`<br>
`knowledgebase/knowledgebase.py`<br>

## Evaluation

The evaluation results are stored in the `output` folder, in separate folders for each approach.


## Installation

The implementation has been developed using Python 3.7.12. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and resolve the dependencies specified in requirements.txt, e.g. using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that due to the incompatibility of some components, the approach does not run under Windows.

## Reproduction of results

The results of this thesis are reproducible by executing `synthetic_evaluation.py` or `realworld_evaluation.py` and setting the corresponding parameters in the Configuration object. The new parameters added in this thesis are the following:

<b>`limit_bos`</b> BO-matching: only use knowledge records which are object independent or correspond to object
<b>`filter_heuristics_rank`</b> Conflict resolution based on provenance of knowledge records
<b>`filter_heuristics_cscore`</b> Conflict resolution based on confidence score of knowledge records

To reproduce the Anomaly Classification results, run `anomalyclassifier.py` in the branch <b>semanticanomalydetection-anomalyclassification</b>. It analyzes the raw results (.ser file) of anomaly detection runs with the extended KB which are stored in this repo. Therefore, there is no need to re-run the anomaly detection itself.
